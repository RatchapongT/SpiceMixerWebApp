<p>Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an <i>m</i>
    x <i>n</i> matrix. This matrix has the
    following properties:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.</li>
    <li>The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the
        previous row.
    </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p> For example,</p>
<p> Consider the following matrix:</p>
<pre>
    [
    [1, 3, 5, 7],
    [10, 11, 16, 20],
    [23, 30, 34, 50]
    ]
</pre>
<p>Given <b>target</b> = <code>3</code>, return <code>true</code>.</p>
