<p> Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer)
    of a researcher, write a function to compute
    the researcher's h-index.
</p>
<p> According to the
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index" target = "_blank">definition
        of h-index on
        Wikipedia</a>: "A scientist has index <i>h</i> if <i>h</i> of his/her
    <i>N</i> papers have <b>at least</b>
    <i>h</i> citations each, and the other <i>N âˆ’ h</i> papers have <b>no more
        than</b> <i>h</i> citations each."
</p>
<p> For example, given <code>citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]</code>,
    which means the researcher has <code>5</code> papers in
    total and each of them had received <code>3, 0, 6, 1, 5</code> citations
    respectively. Since the researcher has
    <code>3</code> papers with <b>at least</b> <code>3</code> citations each and
    the remaining two with <b>no more
        than</b> <code>3</code> citations each, his h-index is <code>3</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If there are several possible values for <code>h</code>, the
    maximum one is taken as the h-index.
</p>
<ol id = "hints">
    <li class = "hint">An easy approach is to sort the array first.</li>
    <li class = "hint">What are the possible values of h-index?</li>
    <li class = "hint">A faster approach is to use extra space.</li>
</ol>
