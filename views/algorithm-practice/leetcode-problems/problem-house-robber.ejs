<p>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
    Each house has a certain amount of money
    stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that
    adjacent houses have security system
    connected and <b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent
        houses were broken into on the same
        night</b>.
</p>
<p>Given a list of non-negative integers representing the
    amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of
    money you can rob tonight <b>without alerting the police</b>.
