<p> Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the
    lexicographically next greater permutation of
    numbers.
</p>
<p> If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it
    as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending
    order).
</p>
<p> The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra
    memory.
</p>
<p> Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column
    and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand
    column.<br> <code>1,2,3</code> → <code>1,3,2</code><br> <code>3,2,1</code> →
    <code>1,2,3</code><br>
    <code>1,1,5</code> → <code>1,5,1</code><br></p>
