<p> Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly
    number.
</p>
<p> Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only
    include <code>2, 3, 5</code>. For example, <code>6,
        8</code> are ugly while <code>14</code> is not ugly since it includes
    another prime factor <code>7</code>.
</p>
<p> Note that <code>1</code> is
    typically treated as an ugly number.
