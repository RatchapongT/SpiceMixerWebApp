<p>Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.</p>
<p>For example,
    given input 43261596 (represented in binary as <b>00000010100101000001111010011100</b>),
    return
    964176192 (represented in binary as <b>00111001011110000010100101000000</b>).
</p>
<p><b>Follow up</b>:<br> If this function is called many times, how would
    you optimize it?
