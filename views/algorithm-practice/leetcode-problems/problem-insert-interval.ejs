<p>Given a set of <i>non-overlapping</i> intervals, insert a new interval
    into the intervals (merge if necessary).
</p>
<p>You may assume that the
    intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
</p>
<p><b>Example
        1:</b><br> Given intervals <code>[1,3],[6,9]</code>, insert and merge
    <code>[2,5]</code> in as <code>[1,5],[6,9]</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Example
        2:</b><br> Given <code>[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]</code>, insert
    and merge <code>[4,9]</code> in as
    <code>[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]</code>.
</p>
<p> This is because the new interval
    <code>[4,9]</code> overlaps with <code>[3,5],[6,7],[8,10]</code>.
