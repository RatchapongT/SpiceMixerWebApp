<p>Follow up for "Unique Paths":</p>
<p>Now consider if some obstacles are
    added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
</p>
<p>An obstacle
    and empty space is marked as <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> respectively
    in the grid.
</p>
<p>For example,<br></p>
<p>There is one obstacle in the
    middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
</p>
<pre>
    [
    [0,0,0],
    [0,1,0],
    [0,0,0]
    ]
</pre>
<p>The total number of unique paths is <code>2</code>.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>
    <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> will be at most 100.
