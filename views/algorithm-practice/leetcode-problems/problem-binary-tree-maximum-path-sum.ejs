<p> Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.</p>
<p>For this
    problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node
    to any node in the tree along
    the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the
    root.
</p>
<p> For example:<br> Given the below binary tree,</p>
<pre>
    1
    / \
    2 3
</pre>
<p></p>
<p> Return <code>6</code>.</p>
