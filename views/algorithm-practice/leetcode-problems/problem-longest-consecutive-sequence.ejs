<p> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest
    consecutive elements sequence.
</p>
<p> For example,<br> Given <code>[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]</code>,<br>
    The longest consecutive elements sequence is <code>[1,
        2, 3, 4]</code>. Return its length: <code>4</code>.
</p>
<p> Your
    algorithm should run in O(<i>n</i>) complexity.
