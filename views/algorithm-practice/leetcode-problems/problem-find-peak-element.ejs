<p>A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.</p>
<p>Given an input array where <code>num[i] ≠ num[i+1]</code>, find a peak
    element and return its index.
</p>
<p>The array may contain multiple peaks, in
    that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
</p>
<p>You may
    imagine that <code>num[-1] = num[n] = -∞</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, in array
    <code>[1, 2, 3, 1]</code>, 3 is a peak element and your function should
    return the index number
    2.
