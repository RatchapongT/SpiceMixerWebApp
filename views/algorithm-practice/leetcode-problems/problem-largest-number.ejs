<p>Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they
    form the largest number.
</p>
<p>For example, given
    <code>[3, 30, 34, 5, 9]</code>, the largest formed number is
    <code>9534330</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: The result may be very large, so you need
    to return a string instead of an integer.
