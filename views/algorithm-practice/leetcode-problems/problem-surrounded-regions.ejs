<p> Given a 2D board containing <code>'X'</code> and <code>'O'</code>,
    capture all regions surrounded by
    <code>'X'</code>.
</p>
<p>A region is captured by flipping all
    <code>'O'</code>s into <code>'X'</code>s in that surrounded region.

<p>
    For example,<br></p>
<pre>
    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X
</pre>
<p></p>

<pre>

    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X
