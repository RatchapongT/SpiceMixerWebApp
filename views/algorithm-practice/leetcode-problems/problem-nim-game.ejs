<p> You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a
    heap of stones on the table, each time one of
    you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone
    will be the winner. You will take the
    first turn to remove the stones.
</p>
<p> Both of you are very clever and
    have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether
    you can
    win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
</p>
<p> For example, if
    there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter
    1, 2, or 3 stones you
    remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.

        way to remove the stones such that you
        will always be the winner?
