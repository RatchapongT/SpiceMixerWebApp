<p> According to the
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target = "_blank">Wikipedia's
        article</a>: "The <b>Game of Life</b>, also known simply as <b>Life</b>,
    is a cellular automaton devised by the
    British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
</p>
<p> Given a
    <i>board</i> with <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> cells, each cell has an initial state
    <i>live</i> (1) or <i>dead</i>
    (0). Each cell interacts with its
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood" target = "_blank">eight
        neighbors</a> (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four
    rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
    article):
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by
        under-population.
    </li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
        generation.
    </li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by
        over-population..
    </li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as
        if by reproduction.
    </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p> Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of
    the board given its current state.
</p>
<p><b>Follow up</b>: <br></p>
<ol>
    <li>Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated
        at the same time: You cannot update
        some cells first and then use their updated values to update other
        cells.
    </li>
    <li>In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle,
        the board is infinite, which would
        cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array.
        How would you address these problems?
    </li>
</ol>
