    <b>Some hints:</b>

    <p>Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)</p>

    <p>If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the
        restriction of using extra space.
    </p>

    <p>You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the
        problem "Reverse Integer", you know that
        the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
    </p>

    <p>There is a more generic way of solving this problem.</p>
