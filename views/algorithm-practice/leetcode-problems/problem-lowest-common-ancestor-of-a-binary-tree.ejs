<p> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two
    given nodes in the tree.
</p>
<p> According to the
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor" target = "_blank">definition
        of LCA on
        Wikipedia</a>: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
    v and w as the lowest node in T that has
    both v and w as descendants (where we allow <b>a node to be a descendant of
        itself</b>).”

<p> For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes <code>5</code>
    and <code>1</code> is <code>3</code>. Another
    example is LCA of nodes <code>5</code> and <code>4</code> is <code>5</code>,
    since a node can be a descendant of
    itself according to the LCA definition.
