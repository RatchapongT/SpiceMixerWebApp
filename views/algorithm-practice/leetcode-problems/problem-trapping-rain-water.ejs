<p> Given <i>n</i> non-negative integers representing an elevation map
    where the width of each bar is 1, compute how
    much water it is able to trap after raining.
</p>
<p> For example, <br> Given
    <code>[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]</code>, return <code>6</code>.

</p>
<p style = "font-size: 11px">The above elevation map is represented by array
    [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6
    units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. <b>Thanks Marcos</b>
