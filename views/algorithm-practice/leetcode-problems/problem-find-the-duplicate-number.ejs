<p> Given an array <i>nums</i> containing <i>n</i> + 1 integers where
    each integer is between 1 and <i>n</i>
    (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume
    that there is only one duplicate number,
    find the duplicate one.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b><br></p>
<ol>
    <li>You <b>must not</b> modify the array (assume the array is read only).
    </li>
    <li>You must use only constant, <i>O</i>(1) extra space.</li>
    <li>Your runtime complexity should be less than
        <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>.
    </li>
    <li>There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be
        repeated more than once.
    </li>
</ol>
