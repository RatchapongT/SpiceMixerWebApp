<p>Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number
    of ’1' bits it has (also known as the
    <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming weight</a>).
</p>
<p>For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation <code>00000000000000000000000000001011</code>,
    so the
    function should return 3.
