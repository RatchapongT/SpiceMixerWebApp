<p> Given an array of numbers <code>nums</code>, in which exactly two
    elements appear only once and all the other
    elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
</p>
<p> For example:</p>
<p> Given <code>nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]</code>,
    return <code>[3, 5]</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>:<br></p>
<ol>
    <li>The order of the result is not important. So in the above example,
        <code>[5, 3]</code> is also correct.
    </li>
    <li>Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you
        implement it using only constant space
        complexity?
    </li>
</ol>
