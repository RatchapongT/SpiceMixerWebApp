<p> Write a program to find the <code>n</code>-th ugly number.</p>
<p>
    Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include <code>2, 3, 5</code>.
    For example, <code>1, 2, 3,
        4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12</code> is the sequence of the first
    <code>10</code> ugly numbers.
</p>
<p> Note that <code>1</code> is typically
    treated as an ugly number.
</p>
<ol id = "hints">
    <li class = "hint">The naive approach is to call <code>isUgly</code> for
        every number until you reach the
        n<sup>th</sup> one. Most numbers are <i>not</i> ugly. Try to focus your
        effort on generating only the ugly ones.
    </li>
    <li class = "hint">An ugly number must be multiplied by either 2, 3, or 5
        from a smaller ugly number.
    </li>
    <li class = "hint">The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers.
        Try a similar approach of merging from
        three sorted lists: L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>.
    </li>
    <li class = "hint">Assume you have U<sub>k</sub>, the k<sup>th</sup> ugly
        number. Then U<sub>k+1</sub> must be
        Min(L<sub>1</sub> * 2, L<sub>2</sub> * 3, L<sub>3</sub> * 5).
    </li>
</ol>
