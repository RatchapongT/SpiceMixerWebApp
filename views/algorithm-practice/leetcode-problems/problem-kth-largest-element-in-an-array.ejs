<p>Find the <b>k</b>th largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the
    kth largest element in the sorted
    order, not the kth distinct element.
</p>
<p>For example,<br> Given <code>[3,2,1,5,6,4]</code>
    and k = 2, return 5.
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b><br> You may assume k is always
    valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
