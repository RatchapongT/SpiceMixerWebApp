<p> There are <i>N</i> gas stations along a circular route, where the
    amount of gas at station <i>i</i> is
    <code>gas[i]</code>.
</p>
<p> You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and
    it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from station <i>i</i>
    to its next station (<i>i</i>+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank
    at one of the gas stations.
