<p>Say you have an array for which the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element is
    the price of a given stock on day <i>i</i>.
</p>
<p>Design an algorithm to
    find the maximum profit. You may complete at most <i>two</i> transactions.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b><br> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same
    time (ie, you must sell the stock before you
    buy again).
