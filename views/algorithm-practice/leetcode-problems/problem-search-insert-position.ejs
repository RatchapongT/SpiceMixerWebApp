<p>Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the
    target is found. If not, return the index where it
    would be if it were inserted in order.
</p>
<p>You may assume no duplicates in
    the array.
</p>
<p> Here are few examples.<br> <code>[1,3,5,6]</code>, 5 →
    2<br> <code>[1,3,5,6]</code>, 2 → 1<br>
    <code>[1,3,5,6]</code>, 7 → 4<br> <code>[1,3,5,6]</code>, 0 → 0
