<p>Say you have an array for which the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element is
    the price of a given stock on day <i>i</i>.
</p>
<p>Design an algorithm to
    find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like
    (ie, buy one and
    sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in
    multiple transactions at the same time
    (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
