<p> For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any
    node as the root. The result graph is then a
    rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are
    called minimum height trees (MHTs).
    Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list
    of their root labels.
</p>
<p><b>Format</b><br> The graph contains
    <code>n</code> nodes which are labeled from <code>0</code> to
    <code>n - 1</code>.
    You will be given the number <code>n</code> and a list of undirected <code>edges</code>
    (each edge is a pair of
    labels).
</p>
<p> You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in
    <code>edges</code>. Since all edges are undirected, <code>[0,
        1]</code> is the same as <code>[1, 0]</code> and thus will not appear
    together in <code>edges</code>.
</p>
<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>
<p> Given <code>n = 4</code>,
    <code>edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]</code></p>
<pre>

    / \
    2 3
</pre>
<p> return <code> [1]</code></p>
<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>
<p> Given <code>n = 6</code>,
    <code>edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]</code></p>
<pre>
    0 1 2

    5
</pre>
<p> return <code> [3, 4]</code></p>

<p><b>Note</b>:</p>
<p> (1) According to the
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)" target = "_blank">definition
        of tree
        on Wikipedia</a>: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two
    vertices are connected by <i>exactly</i> one
    path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
</p>
<p> (2) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest
    downward path between the root and a
    leaf.
