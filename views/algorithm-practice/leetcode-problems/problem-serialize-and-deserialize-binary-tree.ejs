<p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object
    into a sequence of bits so that it can be
    stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network
    connection link to be reconstructed later in the
    same or another computer environment.
</p>
<p>Design an algorithm to
    serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
    serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure
    that a binary tree can be serialized to
    a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree
    structure.
</p>
<p> For example, you may serialize the following tree</p>
<pre>
    1
    / \
    2 3
    / \
    4 5
</pre> as<code>"[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"</code>, just the same as
<a href = "https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree">how LeetCode OJ serializes a
    binary
    tree</a>. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
<p></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Do not use class member/global/static variables to store
    states. Your serialize and deserialize
    algorithms should be stateless.
