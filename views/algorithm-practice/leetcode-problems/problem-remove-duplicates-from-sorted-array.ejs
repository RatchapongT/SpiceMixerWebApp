<p> Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each
    element appear only <i>once</i> and return the
    new length.
</p>
<p> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must
    do this in place with constant memory.
</p>
<p> For example,<br> Given input
    array <i>nums</i> = <code>[1,1,2]</code>,
</p>
<p> Your function should
    return length = <code>2</code>, with the first two elements of <i>nums</i>
    being <code>1</code>
    and <code>2</code> respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the
    new length.
