<p>Given an array <i>S</i> of <i>n</i> integers, find three integers in
    <i>S</i> such that the sum is closest to a given
    number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that
    each input would have exactly one
    solution.
</p>
<pre>
    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
